Project Name: “Team Roster” 

Project Overview: Team Roster is an app that stores information about user-created teams. Users can create members [name, role, image, team] and also create teams [name, image]. Users can view their teams, and add and delete members on their teams, allowing users to create their own dream team. Stylistically Team Roster is designed for American football teams, however, this app can be used for any team creation, including sports, music, business, and entertainment.

User Description | Problem Solved: 
  Users can authenticate using Firebase Oauth, and use Team Roster to create their own American football teams. Members are displayed on rows of cards. The cards display the member's image, name, and role on the team. Each card also has a View, Edit, and Delete button. Teams are also displayed on rows of cards, showing the team image and team name, along with a View, Edit, and Delete Button. When the view button is clicked on a team card, it will display the team name and image at the top and all the team member cards below.
